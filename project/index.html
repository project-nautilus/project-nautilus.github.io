                          <p>NAUTILUS is a project funded by Fundació La Marató de TV3 with the aim to understand pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection, including understanding mild disease and the role of co-infections
/ infection, transmissibility and viral shedding.</p>
<p>Since its notification in December 2019, eighty-eight million cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide. Although
most of these sufferers survive the infection, many people who have suffered from COVID-19 have long-term sequelae or
persistent symptoms. These sequelae directly affect public health and the economy.
COVID-19 can affect the nervous system and cause cognitive and/or emotional disturbances, which cause disability or
decrease quality of life. Research is needed on the impact of COVID-19 on cognition and mental health. These are likely to
contribute to the chronic burden of the disease globally in the coming years.
The NAUTILUS project aims to study people who have suffered from COVID-19 and complain of cognitive impairment to
see if this impairment is related to the severity of the disease. NAUTILUS also pretends, with the data collected, to apply
artificial intelligence methods and determine what factors are decisive in generating these long-term effects.
We will evaluate 420 adults from 19 public hospitals who have suffered from COVID-19 and have cognitive complaints. We
will compare their cognitive, mental health, and functional ability outcomes with 210 healthy people. We will also collect
their socio-demographic traits, disease data, and lifestyle characteristics.
We will study brain MRI images in a subsample of 120 middle-aged people (composed of people with severe and
moderate-mild COVID-19 and healthy people). Besides, we will analyze their smell capacity and evaluate the fundus of
their eye. Similarly, we plan to collect markers of inflammation and brain damage through their blood sample. With all these
results and the demographic and clinical data collected, we will analyze it with artificial intelligence tools.
Three research groups will carry out the study from the Hospital de Terrassa-Consorci Sanitari de Terrassa, the Universitat
de Barcelona, and the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. The three groups have collaborated on joint proposals and
significant publications in their fields, which increase the credibility and validity of this project.
The NAUTILUS project may have implications for developing secondary preventive strategies to reduce the potential longterm
cognitive and mental health consequences of COVID-19. This interdisciplinary approach is expected to make
considerable progress in the treatment of COVID-19 and other systemic diseases.</p>
<p>We expect to identify the neurobehavioral impact of post-COVID-19 individuals and the discriminative
power of multimodal biomarkers in adverse outcomes. Our result would help develop clinically useful models to
predict the neurobehavioral impact to develop future personalized and preventive intervention strategies.</p>
<h2 id="1-hypothesis-and-description-of-the-project-objectives">1. Hypothesis and description of the project objectives</h2>
<p>The multimodal approach proposed in the NAUTILUS project, combining the potential of behavioral and clinical biomarkers
and brain imaging with machine learning algorithms in discriminating COVID-19 relevant factors, will allow us to investigate
the biological mechanisms involved in neurobehavioral (cognitive, emotional, and functional) consequences in COVID-19
recovered patients. NAUTILUS is an observational, cross-sectional study where we will evaluate cognition, mental health,
and functional capacity of post-COVID-19 individuals.
In NAUTILUS-project, we seek to answer three key questions. The first is to know if there is an objective neurobehavioral
impairment in post-COVID-19 people with cognitive complaints and brain connectivity alteration. The second question we
want to answer is whether those alterations are related to disease severity and other potential biological biomarkers of
neuronal damage in COVID-19. Finally, we would like to determine the predictive capacity of social and biological factors in
neurobehavioral consequences and connectivity abnormalities in post-COVID-19 individuals.
Our central hypothesis is that post-COVID-19 individuals with cognitive complaints will have more neurobehavioral
disturbances, as a relevant aspect of sequelae or persistent COVID-19 (hypothesis 1). The greater the disease&rsquo;s severity,
the larger neurobehavioral impairment (hypothesis 2). However, the pathophysiological mechanisms are likely to be
different in severe and mild cases, so we do not know the extent of mild cases' involvement. Another hypothesis is that
COVID-19 will have different structural and functional connectivity than healthy individuals. The greater the disease&rsquo;s
severity, the larger the affectations in brain structure and function (hypothesis 3). Anosmia is a core symptom in COVID-19.
Given the relationship between anosmia, cognitive impairment, and brain abnormalities observed in neurodegenerative
diseases, we will perform smell examination in the middle-age subgroup with objective cognitive impairment. Structural and
functional changes in the retina could be biomarkers for cerebral vascular changes in the brain. Retinal plexus involvement
has been described in post-COVID-19 individuals. We will perform an Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography
(OCTA) examination at the same subgroup. We expect to find a relationship between these tests' results and
neurobehavior and brain connectivity (hypothesis 4). Post-COVID-19 study of some blood markers of inflammation or
neuronal damage can help determine the disease&rsquo;s involvement in neurobehaviour and brain connectivity. A relationship
between blood biomarkers and neurobehavior and brain connectivity is expected (hypothesis 5). Finally, novel
methodological approaches using machine learning techniques will characterize the predictive social and biological factors
determining the infection impact&rsquo;s differential trajectory response (hypothesis 6).</p>
<p>Objectives</p>
<ol>
<li>To examine the impact of the COVID-19 illness on neurobehavior and its relationship with the COVID-19 severity.</li>
<li>To examine the integrity and function connectivity of the brain&rsquo;s grey and white matter in middle-aged post-COVID-19
individuals with subjective and objective cognitive impairment and its relationship with the COVID-19 severity.</li>
<li>To relate the potential biomarkers of neuronal damage (smell function, retinal blood plexuses integrity, and inflammation
blood markers) with neurobehavior and brain connectivity measures in middle-aged severe and moderate-mild post-
COVID-19 individuals.</li>
<li>Develop machine learning-based predictive models of neurobehavior and brain connectivity in COVID-19 based on
demographic characteristics, previous pathologies, lifestyle, clinical data, and biomarkers.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2-methodology">2. Methodology</h2>
<p>1.-Study design: NAUTILUS is an observational study with a cross-sectional design.</p>
<p>2.-Setting: it is multicenter study; it will be performed at 19 sites-public health institutions-Hospitals: 1) Hospital de Terrassa-Consorci Sanitari de Terrassa-CST (líder), (2) Hospital Clínic de Barcelona-HC, (3) Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, (4) Hospital Universitari Arnau de Vilanova, (5) Hospital Universitari de Santa Maria, (6) Hospital Universitari Mútua de Terrassa, (7) Consorci Sanitari Integral, (8) Consorci Hospitalari de Vic, (9) Hospital Tortosa Verge de la Cinta, (10) Hospital Municipal de Badalona, (11) Institut d&rsquo;Assistència Sanitària-Girona, (12) Consorci Sanitari Alt Penedès-Garraf, (13) Fundació Sant Hospital de la Seu d’Urgell, (14) Hospital de Figueres, (15) Hospital de Puigcerdà, (16) Hospital Sant Celoni. (17) Hospital Nostra Senyora Meritxell (Andorra), (18)
Hospital General Cruz Roja San José -Santa Adela (Madrid) i (19) Clínica Universitaria de Psicología (UFPC)(Canàries).</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<h2 id="3-expected-impact">3. Expected impact</h2>
<p>The NAUTILUS project may have implications for developing secondary preventive strategies to reduce the cognitive and
emotional sequelae of covid-19 survivors. Their more immediate scientific-technological impact would be based on the
following considerations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Knowledge generation: (1) determining predictive factors related to persistent symptomatology of COVID-19, (2)
combining the potential of multimodal data, including neurobehavioural and brain imaging, with the emergent applicability
of machine learning algorithms in discriminating COVID-19 relevant factors, (3) transfer knowledge: this interdisciplinary
approach could also yield considerable advances in COVID-19 and other systemic diseases.</li>
<li>The characterization of specific cognitive profiles and neuroanatomical and neurofunctional correlates in Post-COVID-19
individuals will be the basis of new models of rehabilitation for cognitive dysfunction and emotional distress treatment. This
knowledge will be needed to improve the assessment tool selection, the creation of new neuropsychological instruments. It
will help create brief COVID-19-specific behavioral and cognitive screening batteries to easily differentiate patients with
distinct profiles.</li>
<li>Machine learning has been successfully used to create decision support systems for risk stratification, diagnosis, and
disease evolution forecast. We envisage developing novel machine learning-based predictive models of cognitive, mental
health, functionality, and brain connectivity evolution in post-COVID-19 individuals using data collected related to subjects'
characteristics. This exploration&rsquo;s outcomes can help anticipate the COVID-19 course effects and provide decision support
to apply adequate and personalized interventions.</li>
<li>Psychological stress, brain damage, and subsequent cognitive impairment have a substantial economic impact on
direct costs in patients' and caregivers' economies. Improved knowledge about COVID-19 illness may allow identification of
patients at higher risk of severe COVID-19 forms and impact the estimation of the economic burden on affected families.
This information would be highly relevant for social and health policy development.</li>
<li>To promote open science initiatives to increase cooperation and transparency in all research stages, non-commercial
exploitation will include sharing the ML scripts in collaborative platforms (e.g., Github) where others can share and improve
your code for the sake of progress. Unthresholded statistical MRI maps will be uploaded at Neurovault, a public repository
meta-analyses usage. The UB has an institutional research outputs repository publicly accessible. Shortly, this
dissemination policy would benefit more robust scientific results, more efficient research, and access to scientific results for
everyone to turn in greater societal and economic impact.</li>
<li>The data and results obtained will be shared with other research groups to collaborate in international guidelines.
Validation of the results in larger international cohorts could provide clinicians a valuable tool for their daily practice for
disease prognosis. This project will promote fruitful collaboration between leading centers in the Catalan research
scenario, and this framework will foster future joint approaches for funding in national and international calls.</li>
<li>Research fellows associated with this project will have the opportunity to join and work with consolidated research
teams, highly interdisciplinary, with a long tradition in the study of neuropsychology and neuroimaging. Therefore, they can
obtain conceptual and methodological training in various disciplines related to neuroscience.</li>
